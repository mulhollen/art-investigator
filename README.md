# art-investigator

Art, especially gallery art and museum art, can be hard to digest and alienating for children. The goal of Art Investigator is to make museum art understandable, relatable, and fun for children at an early reading age (7-11 years old). Working with Nick Cave's <i>Feat.</i> exhibit at The Frist Center for the Visual Arts  in Nashville, Tennessee, Art Investigator is an interactive tour through the exhibit that focuses on learning, emotional intelligence, and creating interaction points for parents and their children. 

<b>Primary Users</b>

My primary users are Evie and Jack, a first grader and third grader respectively,that are interested in art but often feel like they don’t relate to what they are seeing. They enjoy going to museums but feel like they could be more fun and interactive.

The secondary users are Michelle and Jason, Evie and Jack’s parents. They love introducing their children to art and culture and want their kids to enjoy art. They like to visit museums on the weekend and are always looking for something memorable and fun to do as a family.

<b>Research Plan</b>

The primary user research was done working with a family of four with a daughter and son in the age early reading age range, two additional children in the age range, and a mother and daughter. Interviews were conducted to guage what interests the designated age range when visiting museums and art exhibits. These interviews also helped determine the emotional vs. vocabulary comprehension level as well as their familarility with technology usage. Observations were also conducted at The Adventure Science Center to understand what attracts early-reading-age children. 

Working with Early Childhood Education Teacher, Rebecca Sacramone, and K-12 Education Technology Professional at The Cleveland Institute of Music, Heather Young Mandujano,a lesson plan focusing on Nick Cave and his wide range of artistic mediums, and the related emotional intelligence of vulnerability was developed. Additionally, working with a designer from the Adventure Science Center in Nashville, Tennessee, Jim Savelyev, interaction points for parents and their children were constructed.

<b>Challenge Statement</b>

How might I create an interactive and relatable experience that enables Evie to learn and understand a new art topic, build her vocabulary, and grow her emotional intelligence in a meaningful way - all while creating moments that allow for interaction between her and her Mother and still engaging her in a fun and interesting way.
